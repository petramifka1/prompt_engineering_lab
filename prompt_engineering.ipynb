      "KEY INSIGHTS:\n",
      "1. Few-shot prompting is TRANSFORMATIVE for classification → Use it first\n",
      "2. Structured constraints help but need examples to be truly effective\n",
      "3. Chain of Thought improves extraction quality but doesn't guarantee identical responses\n",
      "4. Consistency is harder with creative tasks than classification tasks\n",
      "5. Temperature (0.7) plays a role in variation - lower temperature = higher consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "NEXT STEPS FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT:\n",
      "1. Test sentiment with temperature=0.0 (deterministic) to confirm perfect reproducibility\n",
      "2. Add few-shot examples to product description prompt\n",
      "3. Combine Chain of Thought + structured format for data extraction\n",
      "4. Test extraction with few-shot patterns: [Pattern A] → [Expected Output]\n",

    "1. Test sentiment with temperature=0.0 (deterministic) to confirm perfect reproducibility\n",
    "2. Add few-shot examples to product description prompt\n",
